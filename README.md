## Dataset Information (Milestone 2)

We intend to study a dataset composed of several environmental parameters concerning 50 lakes in Tasmania. The dataset, titled 'Tasmania_lakes' can be found at Group7-STAT394/PROJECT/DATA/EXCEL/. The full dataset - in the form provided here - is not usually pubicly available, however permission has been granted from researcher and data collector Andrew Rees for its use in this project. An application of the data can be found in Rees et al. (2008), published in the Journal of Paleolimnology. 

The main dataset is composed of 62 variables (environmental parameters) the 50 lakes, with an additional 58 variables concerning chironomid taxa found at the lakes. All variables have been included as numeric, however Andrew Rees has confirmed that up to 20 of the 62 lake variables can be reclassified into at least binary categories of presence/absence to satisfy the categorical variable requirement without extensive data reduction. 

This dataset was chosen (i.e. our motivation) as it provides a novel oppertunity to engage with true peer-reviewed published environmental research, which we believe is a very important implementation of the statistical techniques we are learning. Specifically, the Tasmanian lakes provide a unique oppertunity explore how non-human factors (e.g., natural landcover, precipitation underlying rock type, soil type) influence freshwater quality, an area currently of particular interest in environmental science. Tasmania has a near-binary division in rock type amongst the lakes (felsic, mafic), and great variation in other natural factors like precipitation. We believe there is therefore plenty of scope to explore how these natural drivers may have produced many of the highly-diverse response variables measurements provided (temperature, pH, etc.).

Our preliminary goal at this stage is to explore how the pairing of rock type of rainfall may drive the observed variation in lake surface temperature and pH.
